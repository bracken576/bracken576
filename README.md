# Summary
Throughout 7 years of programming, I have developed a love for problem solving, programming, and sifting through data. I have also gained a respect for what is possible in machine learning as I have done image recognition models in tensorflow and PyTorch with X-rays, mammograms, and elbow MRIs.
