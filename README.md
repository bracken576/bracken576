# Summary
Throughout 7 years of programming, I have developed a love for problem solving, programming, and sifting through data. I have also gained a respect for what is possible in machine learning as I have done image recognition models in tensorflow and PyTorch with X-rays, mammograms, and elbow MRIs.

## Pioneer Baseball League Predictivive Pitch Sequencing, February 2025 - March 2025

#### Collaborators: Tyler English, Annaka McClelland, Logan Ray

[Link to repo](https://github.com/TylerEnglish/GonePhishingBaseball.git)

• Utilized Streamlit in python to create a smoother interaction between the user and our machine learning models

• Used Tabnet for classification of pitches and XGBoostRegressor for number of pitches to strike a batter out

• Worked as a team to complete the project promptly and to the users specifications

• Got to an accuracy of .97 and an F1 score of .76 for the model on number of pitches
